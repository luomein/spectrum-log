# Displaying JSON data in React using DuckDB



The sources primarily focus on using DuckDB within a React application. While they don't mention "dino", it's likely you're referring to **Deno**, a JavaScript runtime. Although the sources don't directly address using Deno with DuckDB, they offer a foundation for understanding how to import, query, and display JSON data using DuckDB within a React context. You would then need to incorporate this functionality within your Deno project.

Here's a breakdown of the process, drawing from the provided sources:

- **Project Setup:**

  - Create a React application using Create React App.
  - Install necessary styling libraries like Tailwind CSS and `@shadcn/ui`.
  - Crucially, install the DuckDB WebAssembly library (`@duckdb/duckdb-wasm`). This enables DuckDB functionality within your React application.

- **Data Loading and DuckDB Integration:**

  - **Load JSON Data:** Use the browser's FileReader API or the fetch API to load your JSON file into memory.

  - **Initialise DuckDB:** Create a DuckDB instance within your React component using `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm`.

  - **Create Table:** You have two options:

    - Define a table schema in DuckDB beforehand to store your data. This involves specifying column names and data types corresponding to your JSON structure.
    - Utilise DuckDB's `read_json_auto` function to infer the schema directly from your JSON data.

  - **Import Data:** Use DuckDB's `read_json_auto` function to efficiently import data from your loaded JSON file into the created table.

  - **Handle Large Files:** If dealing with large JSON files (over 5 million lines), implement "chunked processing" to read and process the data in smaller segments. This helps avoid memory issues.

- **Displaying Data in React:**

  - Once your JSON data is loaded into DuckDB, you can query it using SQL and display the results within your React components.
  - Consider utilising libraries like Recharts, Chart.js, or D3.js to create visualisations based on the queried data.
  - You can use React libraries like `@shadcn/ui` to create tables or other components for data display.

**Key Points:**

- The sources emphasise using DuckDB's `read_json_auto` function for efficient JSON data import and schema inference.
- Ensure your JSON data is properly formatted.
- For optimal performance, especially with larger datasets, consider using appropriate indexing strategies in DuckDB.

**Note:** The sources don't specifically address integrating DuckDB within a Deno environment. You may need to research this aspect further. You might also want to explore how Deno interacts with WebAssembly libraries, as this is crucial for using `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm`.
