# ccmcache fix

If your **Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr)** client is using **up to 40 GB of disk space**, that is significantly higher than the default cache size. This could be due to large software updates, applications, or other content being downloaded and cached. Here are some steps to help you reduce the disk space usage:

### 1. **Manually Clear the Client Cache**
The ConfigMgr client stores downloaded content (such as software, updates, and packages) in a local cache folder. If this cache grows too large, it can take up substantial disk space.

Here’s how you can clear or reduce the cache size:

#### Steps to Clear the Cache:
1. **Open Configuration Manager Properties**:
   - On your laptop, open the **Control Panel**.
   - Go to **System and Security** → **Configuration Manager**.
   
2. **Navigate to the Cache Tab**:
   - In the Configuration Manager properties window, click on the **Cache** tab.

3. **Delete Cache Files**:
   - Click on the **Delete Files** button to remove all files currently stored in the cache.
   - This will free up space by removing old or unnecessary cached content.

4. **Adjust Cache Size**:
   - In the same window, you can adjust the maximum size of the cache by changing the value in the *Maximum cache size (MB)* field.
   - If your cache is set to 40 GB (or higher), you can reduce it to a more reasonable value like 5-10 GB depending on your needs.

#### Command-Line Option:
Alternatively, you can clear the cache using a command-line tool:
```powershell
ccmcache.exe /delete
```

### 2. **Check for Large Applications or Updates**
Some large applications or updates might be consuming a lot of space. You can identify these and remove them if they are no longer needed.

#### Steps:
1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to `C:\Windows\ccmcache` (this is typically where ConfigMgr stores cached content).
2. Check for unusually large files or folders within this directory.
3. If you're sure that certain content is no longer needed, you can manually delete it from this folder.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Be cautious when manually deleting files from `ccmcache`, as some files may still be required by ConfigMgr for ongoing installations or updates.

### 3. **Limit Software Distribution**
If your organization’s IT department is pushing out large software packages through ConfigMgr, these may be taking up significant space on your device.

- You can reach out to your IT department and ask them to review which packages are being deployed to your machine and whether any unnecessary software distributions can be stopped.

### 4. **Check for Logs**
Configuration Manager also generates log files that can grow over time and consume disk space.

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to `C:\Windows\CCM\Logs`.
2. Check for large log files.
3. If any log files are excessively large, you can delete them (but ensure that no critical processes are running).

### 5. **Use Disk Cleanup Tools**
You can use Windows' built-in *Disk Cleanup* tool or *Storage Sense* to free up additional space:

#### Using Disk Cleanup:
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Right-click on your system drive (usually `C:`) and select **Properties**.
3. Click on **Disk Cleanup**, then select system files like temporary files, previous Windows installations, etc., that you want to remove.

#### Using Storage Sense:
1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Storage**.
2. Turn on **Storage Sense**, which will automatically clean up temporary files and manage disk space over time.

### 6. **Reinstall Configuration Manager Client**
If you suspect that there’s an issue with how ConfigMgr is managing its cache or storage, reinstalling the client may help resolve any misconfigurations:

#### Steps:
1. Uninstall Microsoft Configuration Manager client via Control Panel or using a script provided by your IT department.
2. Reinstall it from scratch using a fresh installation package provided by your IT admins.

### Summary of Actions
1. Clear out cached content using Configuration Manager Properties.
2. Adjust the maximum cache size (reduce it from 40 GB).
3. Manually check for large cached files in `C:\Windows\ccmcache` and delete unnecessary ones.
4. Review log file sizes in `C:\Windows\CCM\Logs`.
5. Use Disk Cleanup or Storage Sense to manage temporary files.
6. Contact IT if large software distributions are being pushed unnecessarily.

By following these steps, you should be able to significantly reduce the disk space usage caused by Microsoft Configuration Manager on your laptop!
