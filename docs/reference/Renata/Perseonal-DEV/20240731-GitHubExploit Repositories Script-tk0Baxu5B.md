#How To: Search GitHub for AI Jailbreak and Exploit Repositories

This document provides step-by-step instructions to create and use a tool that searches GitHub for repositories related to AI jailbreak code or AI exploits, ensuring they are no older than three weeks. The results will be saved in a Markdown file with the repository URLs and descriptions.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- GitHub personal access token with necessary permissions (repo, read:org, etc.)
- Python 3 installed
- Pip installed

## Step 1: Set Up a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens**.
3. Click on **Generate new token**.
4. Select the necessary permissions (repo, read:org, etc.).
5. Generate the token and save it in a secure place.

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Open a terminal and install the `requests` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 3: Create the Python Script

1. Create a new file named `github_search_ai.py`.
2. Copy and paste the following script into the file:

```python
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Replace 'your_token' with your GitHub personal access token
GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_token'
GITHUB_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories'

# Calculate the date three weeks ago
three_weeks_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(weeks=3)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Function to search GitHub repositories
def search_github(query, sort='stars', order='desc'):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'token {GITHUB_TOKEN}',
        'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
    }

    params = {
        'q': f'{query} created:>{three_weeks_ago}',
        'sort': sort,
        'order': order,
        'per_page': 100
    }

    response = requests.get(GITHUB_API_URL, headers=headers, params=params)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        print(response.text)
        return None

# Function to extract relevant information from the search results
def extract_info(repo):
    return {
        'name': repo['name'],
        'full_name': repo['full_name'],
        'html_url': repo['html_url'],
        'description': repo['description'] or "No description provided.",
        'stars': repo['stargazers_count'],
        'language': repo['language'],
        'created_at': repo['created_at'],
        'updated_at': repo['updated_at']
    }

# Function to save the results to a Markdown file
def save_to_markdown(repositories, filename='github_search_results.md'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write("# GitHub Repositories for AI Jailbreak and Exploits (Created in the Last 3 Weeks)\n\n")
        for repo in repositories:
            f.write(f"## [{repo['name']}]({repo['html_url']})\n")
            f.write(f"**Description**: {repo['description']}\n")
            f.write(f"**Stars**: {repo['stars']}\n")
            f.write(f"**Language**: {repo['language']}\n")
            f.write(f"**Created at**: {repo['created_at']}\n")
            f.write(f"**Updated at**: {repo['updated_at']}\n\n")

# Main function
def main():
    query = 'ai jailbreak OR ai exploit'
    results = search_github(query)

    if results:
        repositories = results.get('items', [])
        extracted_info = [extract_info(repo) for repo in repositories]

        # Save results to a Markdown file
        save_to_markdown(extracted_info)

        print(f"Found {len(repositories)} repositories.")
    else:
        print("No results found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 4: Run the Script

1. Make the script executable (optional):
    ```bash
    chmod +x github_search_ai.py
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python3 github_search_ai.py
    ```

## Step 5: Check the Results

After running the script, a Markdown file named `github_search_results.md` will be created in the same directory. This file contains the URLs and descriptions of the repositories related to AI jailbreak and exploits that were created in the last three weeks.

## Example Output

The `github_search_results.md` file will look something like this:

```markdown
# GitHub Repositories for AI Jailbreak and Exploits (Created in the Last 3 Weeks)

## [Repo Name](https://github.com/user/repo)
**Description**: Description of the repository.
**Stars**: 123
**Language**: Python
**Created at**: 2023-07-01T00:00:00Z
**Updated at**: 2023-07-10T00:00:00Z

## [Another Repo Name](https://github.com/user/another-repo)
**Description**: Another description.
**Stars**: 456
**Language**: JavaScript
**Created at**: 2023-07-05T00:00:00Z
**Updated at**: 2023-07-10T00:00:00Z
```

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and using a tool that searches GitHub for AI jailbreak and exploit repositories, ensuring they are no older than three weeks. The results are saved in a Markdown file for easy review and sharing.

Feel free to adjust the search query or the extracted information as needed.
