# VSCode Change PowerShell Execution Policy

### 1. **Change PowerShell Execution Policy in VSCode**
You can change the execution policy for PowerShell specifically in the VSCode terminal by running this command directly in the VSCode terminal:

```powershell

If you want to change the execution policy permanently while working in VSCode, you can modify it as described earlier:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

This will persist outside of the current terminal session and will affect any other PowerShell session launched from VSCode.

If you donâ€™t want to change the execution policy permanently but need to execute a script, you can bypass the policy for that script by running:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File beatbear.ps1"
```

This command allows you to run the script with the **Bypass** execution policy without changing the system settings.

### 5. **Restart VSCode**
After changing the execution policy, it's sometimes necessary to restart Visual Studio Code for the
