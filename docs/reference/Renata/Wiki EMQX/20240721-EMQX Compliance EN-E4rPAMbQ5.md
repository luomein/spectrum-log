### TISAX

TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) is a standardized framework for conducting information security assessments and facilitating information exchange, designed to ensure the security of data within supply chains. Spearheaded by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), TISAX has achieved broad acceptance across the global automotive sector. TISAX certification allows companies to demonstrate adherence to industry data security and information exchange standards, enhancing trust among partners and customers. While it is a benchmark in the automotive industry, TISAX is also extensively adopted in other sectors for information security assessments. EMQ is proud to have achieved the VDA-TISAX Information Security High Level (AL2) certification.

### SOC 1

The SOC 1 report, issued in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), or in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, provides management of the service organization, user entities, and the independent auditors of the user entities with information and a service auditor's report related to the service organization's processes and controls affecting the entity's internal control over financial reporting. The SOC 1 report includes an opinion on the fairness of the system's description, the suitability of the design of the controls to achieve specified control objectives, and, in a type 2 report, the operating effectiveness of those controls.

The SOC 2 report has become an important reference for domestic and international enterprises when choosing a third-party cloud service provider. Achieving compliance ensures that EMQ has robust controls in place to protect its systems and data. With its SOC 2 compliance, EMQ provides customers with the confidence that their data is continually protected by EMQ’s platform.
