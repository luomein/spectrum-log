# Resolving Remote Desktop Login Issues on Windows 11 with a Microsoft Account

## Problem

When attempting to log into a Windows 11 PC via Remote Desktop (RDP) using the Microsoft account `mostrub@live.de`, access is denied despite correct credentials.

## Solution

To address this issue, follow these steps:

### 1. Synchronize Your Microsoft Account Password Locally

Ensure your Microsoft account password is cached locally:

- Open Command Prompt:
  - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.
- Execute the following command:
  ```shell
  runas /u:MicrosoftAccount\mostrub@live.de cmd.exe
  ```
- When prompted, enter your Microsoft account password.
- A new Command Prompt window should open, indicating successful credential caching.

This process ensures your Microsoft account password is stored locally, which is necessary for RDP authentication. 

### 2. Attempt RDP Connection

Now, try connecting to your Windows 11 PC via Remote Desktop:

- Open the Remote Desktop client.
- Enter the following credentials:
  - **Username**: `MicrosoftAccount\mostrub@live.de`
  - **Password**: Your Microsoft account password

Ensure you use the correct password associated with your Microsoft account.

## Alternative Solution

If the issue persists, consider creating a local account on the remote PC and using those credentials for RDP access. This approach can sometimes bypass authentication problems associated with Microsoft accounts. 

By following these steps, you should be able to establish a Remote Desktop connection using your Microsoft account credentials without needing to reboot the remote PC.
