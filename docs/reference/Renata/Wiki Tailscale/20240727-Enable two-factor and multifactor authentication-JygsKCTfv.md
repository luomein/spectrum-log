# Enable two-factor and multifactor authentication

Tailscale relies on your existing [identity provider](https://tailscale.com/kb/1013/sso-providers) to authenticate users. Any authentication settings from your identity provider are *automatically used* by Tailscale, including MFA.

To enable MFA for your domain, set it up from your identity provider.
