# Cybersecurity Alphabet


## A - Authentication
**Definition:** Process of verifying the identity of a user, a device, or an entity accessing a computer system.

## B - Botnet
**Definition:** A network of infected computers controlled by an attacker, often used for launching attacks.

## C - Command and Control (C&C)
**Definition:** System used by attackers to remotely manage compromised systems, issue commands, and exfiltrate data.

## D - Digital Signature
**Definition:** A cryptographic stamp that verifies the authenticity and integrity of a digital document.

## E - Entropy
**Definition:** Measure of randomness in data, critical for creating strong encryption keys and passwords that resist guessing.

## F - Fuzzing
**Definition:** Software testing technique that uses invalid, unexpected, or randomized input data to uncover vulnerabilities.

## G - Grey Hat
**Definition:** A hacker who operates in a murky area, potentially breaking rules to expose security flaws, but without malicious intent.

## H - Honeypot
**Definition:** A decoy system or network designed to attract cyber attackers and study their attack techniques.

## I - Integrity
**Definition:** Assurance that data has not been altered or tampered with, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

## J - Jailbreaking
**Definition:** Process of bypassing a device's manufacturer restriction to install unauthorized software on the device.

## K - Keylogger
**Definition:** Type of surveillance software that records keystrokes made by a user to steal sensitive information.

## L - Least Privilege
**Definition:** Principle that users should be granted the minimum level of access needed to perform their job functions.

## M - Microsegmentation
**Definition:** Divides a network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of an attack within a network.

## N - Nonce
**Definition:** A random number used in cryptography to ensure that old sessions cannot be reused in replay attacks.

## O - Obfuscation
**Definition:** Art of manipulating code or data to make it intentionally hard to understand and reverse-engineer.

## P - Pharming
**Definition:** Cyber attack that deceives users by redirecting them to fake websites to steal personal information.

## Q - Quarantine
**Definition:** Isolation of potentially malicious files or compromised systems to prevent further spread of malware.

## R - Rootkit
**Definition:** Malicious software designed to gain unauthorized root access while hiding its presence.

## S - SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
**Definition:** Tool that collects and analyzes security data from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents.

## T - Typosquatting
**Definition:** Lures users to fake websites by registering domain names with common misspellings of legitimate ones.

## U - Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)
**Definition:** Realization of two-factor authentication using a physical hardware token.

## V - Vishing
**Definition:** Voice-based phishing attack where attackers impersonate others over the phone to steal personal data.

## W - Whitelisting
**Definition:** Security practice that only allows pre-approved users, devices, or apps to access a system.

## X - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
**Definition:** Vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.

## Y - Yellow Team
**Definition:** Combine red team and blue team efforts to improve overall security through shared knowledge.

## Z - Zero-Day
**Definition:** Security vulnerability actively exploited by attackers before software vendor knows about or fixes it.
