Azure Digital Twins

Set up an automatic data flow from a simulated IoT Hub device into Azure Digital Twins. Combine this data with business logic to update digital twin properties.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to...

* Identify which Azure services are used to carry IoT data to Azure Digital Twins.
* Describe the flow of data from a connected IoT device through supportive Azure services into Azure Digital Twins.
* Create Azure functions to define how twins should be updated, based on device data and business logic.

## Prerequisites

* Understanding of how models, twins, and relationships are used in an Azure Digital Twins solution.
* Experience with programming concepts at the intermediate level.
* An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free), and permission to manage access to Azure resources in the subscription (or cooperation from someone that does have that permission, who can run some commands on your behalf).
* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the Azure development workload.
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
