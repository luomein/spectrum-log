## Executive Summary

This security statement outlines the comprehensive security architecture and controls implemented for the Renata SA MQTT IIoT project. The system facilitates data collection, processing, and analysis from manufacturing facilities, utilizing EMQX Enterprise as the MQTT broker, Azure cloud services hosted in Swiss regions, and AWS integration through a Swiss-based partner for visualization purposes. All components and operations are subject to Swiss law and regulations.

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Architecture Components

The MQTT IIoT system consists of:

- Edge Layer:
  - Siemens S7-1500 SPS for production line control

  - Edge computing devices with NanoMQ for local MQTT processing

- Gateway Layer:
  - Moxa industrial IoT gateways
  - Edge computing devices for local data processing
  - MQTT protocol conversion and data preprocessing

- MQTT Broker Layer:
  - EMQX Enterprise Cluster hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Minimum 3-node configuration for high availability
  - Hosted in Azure Switzerland North (Zurich)

- Cloud Services Layer:
  - Azure IoT Hub for device management
  - Azure Event Hubs for data stream ingestion
  - Azure Stream Analytics for real-time processing
  - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for long-term storage
  - AWS services (via Swiss partner) for data visualization

### 1.2 Data Flow

1. Data collection from production equipment and sensors
2. Edge processing and local MQTT communication
3. Secure transmission to EMQX broker
4. Processing through Azure services
5. Storage in Swiss-based Azure Data Lake
6. Visualization data transfer to AWS (via Swiss partner)
