## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the data security measures and compliance controls implemented by Renata SA in the production of batteries for ABIT. It focuses on the secure data flow from our Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in the Operational Technology (OT) production line to data storage. Compliance and audit processes are exclusively managed by the Operational Technology Manager (OTM), Marc Strub. K&S are involved solely as a maintenance team for the hardware they built. Additionally, unannounced audits are conducted by an independent internal Audit Team from our parent company, the Swatch Group. This document ensures adherence to EU regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to meet ABIT's compliance requirements.

## **10. Data Transfer from Switzerland to the EU**

### **10.1 Compliance with GDPR**

Storing all our data in Switzerland while serving customers in the EU involves navigating both Swiss data protection laws and the EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Switzerland is recognized by the EU as providing an adequate level of data protection, which facilitates data transfers between the two regions without requiring additional safeguards.

#### **10.1.1 Key GDPR Requirements**

- **Data Processing Agreements**: We have appropriate data processing agreements in place with any third parties involved in handling the data.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Processes are implemented to uphold the rights of data subjects, such as the right to access, rectify, or delete their data.
- **Lawful Basis for Processing**: A lawful basis for processing personal data is established, such as consent or contractual necessity.

Storing data in Switzerland aligns with GDPR requirements, provided that the Swiss data protection standards meet or exceed those mandated by the GDPR.

### **10.2 Azureâ€™s Support for Compliance**

Azure offers robust tools and services to help ensure compliance with both Swiss data protection laws and GDPR:

- **Compliance Certifications**: Azureâ€™s Swiss data centers comply with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and are aligned with GDPR requirements, providing necessary compliance certifications.
- **Data Encryption**: Azure ensures that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, safeguarding against unauthorized access.
- **Access Controls**: Granular access controls help manage who can access data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions.

### **10.3 Data Residency Benefits**

Storing data in Switzerland offers several advantages:

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Switzerlandâ€™s stringent data protection laws provide a high level of privacy.
- **Reduced Latency**: For Swiss-based operations, local data storage results in lower latency and improved performance.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Operating within Switzerlandâ€™s legal framework simplifies compliance, as we are subject to a single set of data protection laws recognized as adequate by the EU.

### **10.4 Implementing Data Protection Measures**

To ensure full compliance and secure data handling, we have implemented the following measures:

- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to verify compliance with both Swiss and EU data protection regulations.
- **Training and Awareness**: Staff are trained on data protection best practices and GDPR requirements to minimize the risk of data breaches.
- **Incident Response Plan**: An incident response plan is developed and maintained to address potential data breaches promptly and effectively.

### **10.5 Conclusion**

Storing data in Switzerland while serving EU customers leverages Switzerlandâ€™s strong data protection laws and Azureâ€™s compliant infrastructure. By ensuring compliance with GDPR and implementing robust data protection measures, we effectively manage and protect our EU customersâ€™ data.

**Implementation Note**: This document will be maintained in our document management system with version control and regular reviews. It addresses the specific concerns of ABIT regarding data security, data flow, and compliance with EU regulations, ensuring transparency and adherence to the highest standards of data protection. The OTM, Marc Strub, is exclusively responsible for compliance and audit processes, ensuring independence and enforcement of compliance from hardware installation to access control and audits. Additionally, unannounced audits by the Swatch Group's internal Audit Team provide independent assessments of our compliance practices.
