# Quick Reference

1. **Asset Management**  
   - **OT**: Passive inventory of critical devices (e.g., SCADA, PLCs).  
   - **IT**: Active scans for computers, servers, software, often using automated tools.

2. **Network Segmentation**  
   - **OT**: Use zones to isolate processes; limit lateral movement.  
   - **IT**: Network segmentation via VLANs and DMZ for securing business units.

3. **Vulnerability Management and Patching**  
   - **OT**: Limited patching windows; extensive testing due to real-time processes.  
   - **IT**: Regular patches, faster deployment cycles to address software vulnerabilities.

4. **Access Control and Identity Management**  
   - **OT**: Role-based access, multi-factor authentication; limit direct physical access.  
   - **IT**: Directory-based identity management (e.g., Active Directory), broader access.

5. **Network Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**  
   - **OT**: Passive monitoring, anomaly-based alerts, specific to control networks.  
   - **IT**: Active traffic monitoring, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

6. **Incident Response Planning**  
   - **OT**: Focus on minimizing impact to physical processes; extensive scenario testing.  
   - **IT**: Incident management often more data-centric, e.g., isolating compromised endpoints.

7. **Physical Security Measures**  
   - **OT**: Strict control over physical access to control equipment; cameras, secured rooms.  
   - **IT**: Data centers protected with badge access, CCTV, server rack locks.

8. **Security Awareness and Training for Personnel**  
   - **OT**: Training emphasizes both cyber and physical safety; operational awareness.  
   - **IT**: General cybersecurity training; focus on phishing and data handling.

9. **Backup and Recovery Planning**  
   - **OT**: Backup for configurations and programs; tested with minimal operational impact.  
   - **IT**: Regular file and system backups; cloud integration for rapid data recovery.

10. **Risk Assessment and Governance Framework**  
    - **OT**: Continuous risk analysis with emphasis on safety, reliability, and availability.  
    - **IT**: Regular risk assessment with an emphasis on confidentiality, integrity, and compliance.
