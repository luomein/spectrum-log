# My OT going Forward

## Key Steps and Insights

### 1. Understanding the Threat Landscape
   - **Ransomware Surge**: Manufacturing is highly targeted, with ransomware attacks increasing by 50% in 2023, affecting 70% of companies.
   - **Attack Tactics**:
     - **Living Off the Land (LOTL)**: Attackers use system tools to move laterally and avoid detection.
     - **Exploiting Public-Facing Devices**: Internet-exposed devices are often targeted for unauthorized access.
   - **Notable Incidents**: Dole, Brunswick, and Boeing have experienced ransomware impacts, with losses exceeding millions and major operational downtime.

### 2. Key Security Challenges in Manufacturing
   - **Network Segmentation**: Many manufacturing environments lack segmentation, allowing breaches to spread easily.
   - **IT/OT Dependencies**: Shared architectures make OT systems vulnerable to IT breaches.
   - **Remote Access Security**: Poorly configured remote access and exposed services increase risk.
   - **Security Maturity**: Lack of network visibility, secure remote access, vulnerability management, and incident response protocols.

### 3. Identifying Crown Jewels
   - **Definition**: Crown jewels are critical assets essential to operations; their compromise can cause major disruptions.
   - **Five-Layer Model**: Dragosâ€™ model identifies:
     - System owners
     - Critical systems and subsystems
     - Key functions and components (e.g., robotic arms, SCADA systems)
     - Network controllers and data paths
   - **Purpose**: Identifying these assets helps create targeted strategies to protect essential resources.

### 4. Using Threat Scenarios for Risk Assessment
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Risk Assessment**: Identifies weaknesses for prioritized resource allocation.
     - **Preparedness and Defense**: Simulations refine controls and test response plans.
     - **Training**: Exercises build a security-aware culture and support compliance.
   - **Common Scenarios**: Ransomware, vendor compromise, IT/OT dependencies, and ICS-targeting malware (e.g., PIPEDREAM).
   - **Guidance**: Each scenario includes preventive, detection, and response recommendations.

### 5. Implementing the SANS ICS Five Critical Controls
   - **Framework Components**:
     - **Incident Response Plan**: An OT-specific plan enables swift and effective response.
     - **Secure Remote Access**: Multi-factor authentication and encrypted communication for OT access.
     - **Vulnerability Management**: Prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities.
     - **Defensible Architecture**: Segmentation and isolation minimize incident spread.
     - **Network Visibility and Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring detects anomalies early.
   - **Phased Approach**: Implement, operationalize, and optimize to mature security programs.

### 6. Choosing the Right Cybersecurity Partner
   - **Dragos Platform**: Provides real-time visibility, threat detection, and incident response for OT environments.
   - **OT Watch**: Continuous monitoring service with advanced threat detection.
   - **Dragos WorldView Threat Intelligence**: Offers OT-specific threat alerts and insights.
   - **Integration with SANS Controls**: Dragos solutions support each of the SANS Five Critical Controls, helping manufacturers maintain security and regulatory compliance.

### Case Study: Boston Beer Company
   - **Tabletop Exercises**: Engaged C-suite and board members in simulations to emphasize vulnerabilities.
   - **Dragos Platform**: Enabled asset inventory, operational troubleshooting, and security improvements.
   - **Cultural Shift**: A 300% increase in suspicious email reporting demonstrated a more vigilant workforce.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **100% ROI in First Year**
     - **15% Reduction in Cybersecurity Insurance Premiums**
   - **Conclusion**: Strategic cybersecurity investment can reduce costs, enhance defense, and support operational resilience.
