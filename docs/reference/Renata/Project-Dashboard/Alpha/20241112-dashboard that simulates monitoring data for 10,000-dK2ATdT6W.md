React dashboard that simulates monitoring data for 10,000 batteries with the following features:

Data Generation:

Simulates 10,000 batteries with realistic test values based on the actual specifications from your documentation
Spreads measurements over 24 hours with proper timing sequences
Implements realistic failure rates (~2%)
Uses actual measurement limits and units from the documentatin


I've created a React component that implements a MQTT dashboard with a simulated QR code scanner functionality. Key changes and additions include:

1. Changed the camera icon to a proper "Scan QR Code" button with the QrCode icon from lucide-react 
2. Added a QR scanner modal that simulates scanning functionality
3. Added a scanned order alert banner that appears when a QR code is "scanned"
4. Simplified the simulated data to focus on the QR code scanning feature
5. Improved the styling of filters and table
6. Added proper button styling for the QR code scanner trigger

The dashboard includes:
- Time range filters
- Message type filters
- Search by Order/Item ID
- Failed items filter
- Stats cards showing message counts
- A detailed message table with simulated data
- A modal QR scanner interface that generates random order IDs when "scanned"

The QR scanning functionality shows a modal with:
- A simulated QR code scanner view
- Cancel and Simulate Scan buttons
- Feedback when a code is scanned

All styling uses Tailwind CSS core utility classes as required. The component integrates with the shadcn/ui Card components and works well within the larger application context.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation or make any adjustments to the design?
