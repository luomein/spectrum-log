# Study Guide Building a React Dashboard with DuckDB and JSON



This guide covers importing JSON data into DuckDB and visualising it in a React dashboard.

**Central Questions to Review:**

1. **DuckDB Connection:** How do you establish a connection to DuckDB in both Python and JavaScript environments (especially within a React application)? What are the options for database persistence (file vs. in-memory)?
2. **JSON Data Handling:** How can you load JSON data in a browser environment? Explain the use of FileReader and fetch APIs. What strategies are important for handling large JSON files efficiently? Describe the concept of chunked processing.
3. **read\_json\_auto Function:** How does the read\_json\_auto function work in DuckDB? How can you use it to import JSON data into a specified table or let DuckDB infer the schema? Compare and contrast the usage in Python and JavaScript with @duckdb/duckdb-wasm.
4. **React Dashboard Integration:** Explain the steps involved in setting up a React project for this purpose. What are the key libraries used for styling, UI components, and DuckDB integration?
5. **Dashboard Components:** Describe the purpose and implementation of filters, statistics cards, a message table, and a QR code scanner in the context of the dashboard. How can shadcn/ui be used to build these components? How do you integrate a QR code scanner library?
6. **Data Visualisation:** What are suitable JavaScript charting libraries for the dashboard? How can you prepare data for visualisation using DuckDB queries? What types of visualisations are appropriate for this type of data (histograms, scatter plots, line charts)?
7. **Performance and Deployment:** How can indexing in DuckDB improve performance? What are the key considerations for error handling, code quality, and deployment (local vs. server)?

**Glossary of Key Terms and Ideas:**

- **DuckDB:** An in-process analytical database management system. It is designed to be embedded within other applications and offers fast performance for analytical queries.
- **@duckdb/duckdb-wasm:** The DuckDB WebAssembly library, allowing DuckDB to run in web browsers.
- **read\_json\_auto:** A DuckDB function that automatically reads JSON data and infers the schema.
- **Chunked Processing:** A technique for handling large files by breaking them into smaller chunks and processing each chunk individually to avoid memory issues.
- **FileReader API:** A browser API for reading file contents asynchronously.
- **fetch API:** A browser API for making HTTP requests to retrieve resources, including JSON data.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Create React App:** A tool for setting up new React projects quickly.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling web applications.
- **shadcn/ui:** A React UI component library.
- **QR Code Scanner:** A library/tool to read QR codes.
- **Recharts/Chart.js/D3.js:** Popular JavaScript charting libraries for creating interactive visualisations.
- **Indexing:** A database technique for optimising query performance by creating data structures that allow faster data retrieval.
- **WebAssembly (Wasm):** A binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It allows running code written in languages like C++ in web browsers, significantly improving performance compared to JavaScript.
- **In-memory Database:** A database that resides entirely in RAM. It offers fast performance but data is lost when the application closes.
- **File-based Database:** A database stored in a file on disk. Data is persistent across application sessions.
- **payload field:** In the context of this guide, a JSON field within the imported data containing detailed information. Parsing this field is crucial for insightful analysis.
- **Pagination:** Dividing large datasets into smaller pages for easier display and navigation in user interfaces.
- **Sorting:** Ordering data based on specified criteria, improving data presentation and analysis.
- **Filters:** Interactive elements in a dashboard allowing users to select subsets of data based on certain criteria.
- **Statistics Cards:** UI elements displaying key metrics and summaries of the data.

This study guide provides a framework for understanding the key concepts and steps involved in building a React dashboard with DuckDB and JSON data. Reviewing these questions and understanding the terminology will prepare you for implementing such a project. Remember to consult external documentation and resources for specific library usage and implementation details.
