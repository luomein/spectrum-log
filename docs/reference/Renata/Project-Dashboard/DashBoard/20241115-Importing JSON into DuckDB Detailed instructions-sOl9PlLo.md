# Importing JSON into DuckDB Detailed instructions

## Importing JSON into DuckDB

To import JSON data into DuckDB, you can leverage the read\_json\_auto function. This function efficiently reads JSON data and automatically infers the schema. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the provided sources:

**1. Establish a DuckDB Connection:**
  
- First, import the necessary DuckDB library. This might be the @duckdb/duckdb-wasm library for web applications \[1, 2].
- Next, create a connection to your DuckDB database. You can specify a database file or use an in-memory database. \[1, 2]

**2. Prepare Your Data:**

- Ensure you have your JSON data loaded and accessible. You can use methods like the browser's FileReader API, the fetch API, or standard file reading techniques in Python. \[1]
- For exceptionally large JSON files (over 5 million lines), consider employing chunked processing. This involves reading and processing the file in smaller segments to prevent memory overload. \[1, 3]

**3. Create Your Target Table (Optional):**

- If you haven't already, create a table in your DuckDB database to house the imported JSON data. \[1]
- Define the table schema with appropriate column names and data types to match your JSON structure. \[1, 2, 4]
- For instance:

CREATE TABLE mqtt\_messages (

id VARCHAR,

createAt TIMESTAMP,

topic VARCHAR,

payload JSON

);

**4. Execute the Import:**

- Utilise the read\_json\_auto function within a DuckDB execute statement to import your data. \[1, 5]
- Provide the path to your JSON file as an argument to read\_json\_auto. \[1, 5]
- If you created a table in step 3, use an INSERT INTO statement to populate it. Otherwise, DuckDB will create a table based on the inferred schema. \[1, 5]

**Example using Python:**

import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect('your\_database.duckdb')

\# Import data directly into a table

con.execute("""

INSERT INTO mqtt\_messages

SELECT \* FROM read\_json\_auto('your\_json\_file.json');

""")

**Example using JavaScript:**

import \* as duckdb from '@duckdb/duckdb-wasm';

// ...DuckDB initialisation...

const conn = await db.connect();

// Assuming 'jsonData' holds your loaded JSON data

await conn.execute(\`

INSERT INTO mqtt\_messages

SELECT \* FROM read\_json\_auto(?);

\`, \[jsonData]);

**5. Verification:**

- After the import, you can query your DuckDB database to confirm the data has been successfully loaded. \[1, 6]

**Important Notes:**

- The provided sources primarily focus on Python examples. If using JavaScript, you might need to consult the @duckdb/duckdb-wasm documentation for specific syntax and usage details.
- Ensure your JSON data is properly formatted for DuckDB to interpret it correctly.
- Remember to adjust file paths and table names according to your project setup.

### New saved note

Here's how to use a React app dashboard to load a JSON file and DuckDB, based on the provided sources:

### **1. Project Setup**

- **Frontend:** Create a React app using Create React App:
- npx create-react-app my-mqtt-dashboard
- cd my-mqtt-dashboard
- **Styling:** Install Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui:
- npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
- npx tailwindcss init -p
- npm install @shadcn/ui
- **DuckDB:** Install the DuckDB WebAssembly library:
- npm install @duckdb/duckdb-wasm

### **2. Data Loading and DuckDB Integration**

- **JSON Loading:** Use the browser's FileReader API or the fetch API to load your JSON file into memory \[1].
- **DuckDB Initialization:** Initialize a DuckDB database instance in your React component using @duckdb/duckdb-wasm \[2].
- **Table Creation:** Create a table in DuckDB to store the data from your JSON file, ensuring to parse the payload field appropriately.
- CREATE TABLE mqtt\_messages (
- id VARCHAR,
- createAt TIMESTAMP,
- topic VARCHAR,
- payload JSON,
- orderId INTEGER,
- itemId INTEGER,
- result BOOLEAN -- Add other relevant fields from payload
- );
- **Data Insertion:** Use DuckDB's read\_json\_auto function to efficiently import the data from your JSON file into the created table \[2].
- import \* as duckdb from '@duckdb/duckdb-wasm';
-
- // ... your component logic ...
-
- const worker = new Worker(
- new URL('@duckdb/duckdb-wasm/dist/duckdb.worker.js', import.meta.url),
- )
- const logger = new duckdb.ConsoleLogger();
- const db = new duckdb.AsyncDuckDB(logger, worker);
- await db.instantiate('mqtt\_data.duckdb');
- const conn = await db.connect();
-
- // Assuming 'jsonData' holds your loaded JSON data
- await conn.execute(\`
- INSERT INTO mqtt\_messages
- SELECT \* FROM read\_json\_auto(?);
- \`, \[jsonData]);
- **Chunked Processing:** For files exceeding 5 million lines, consider using chunked processing to handle the data in manageable portions \[3]. This involves reading and processing the file in smaller segments to avoid overwhelming memory.

### **3. Dashboard Components**

- **Filters:** Build React components to filter data based on:
- Time range using a date picker component.
- Message type by selecting from available topics.
- Order ID and Item ID using input fields.
- Failed items using a checkbox or toggle.
- **Statistics Cards:** Create cards using shadcn/ui to display:
- Total messages: SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM mqtt\_messages
- Successful/failed messages: SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM mqtt\_messages WHERE result = true/false
- Calculate other relevant statistics using DuckDB queries.
- **Message Table:** Use shadcn/ui to create a table component:
- Fetch data from DuckDB using queries that include the applied filters.
- Implement sorting and pagination for efficient data display \[4].
- **QR Code Scanner:** Integrate a QR code scanning library (you'll likely need to search for and install one yourself). For now, simulate scanning by generating random Order IDs \[1].

### **4. Data Insights and Visualisation**

- **Visualisation Libraries:** Install a charting library such as Recharts, Chart.js, or D3.js.
- **Data Preparation:** Use DuckDB to query and aggregate data as needed for your chosen visualizations \[5, 6].
- **Visualisations:** Create visualisations such as:
- Histograms and bar charts for inspection result distribution.
- Scatter plots or heatmaps to correlate inspection results with material consumption.
- Line charts to visualize trends like material consumption over time \[7].

### **5. Additional Considerations**

- **Performance:** Use appropriate indexing strategies in DuckDB to optimize query performance.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data loading, database operations, and API calls.
- **Code Quality:** Ensure well-commented and documented code for maintainability.
- **Deployment:** Consider how you'll deploy your app. DuckDB can run in-process, making it suitable for local PC deployments as well as server deployments \[1].

Remember that this is a general guide. You will need to research and fill in specific implementation details using libraries and techniques relevant to your chosen tools and frameworks. For example, the sources do not specifically mention which QR code scanning library is best.

This response draws on information from all of your provided sources. However, information on topics such as QR code scanning libraries may need to be sought out from external sources. You may wish to verify this information independently.
