### Understanding the Challenges

**ICS/OT networks present unique challenges for implementing Zero Trust** compared to traditional IT environments. These include:

- **Legacy Systems:** Many ICS/OT systems rely on legacy equipment and protocols that were not designed with security in mind \[1-3]. These systems may lack basic security features, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks.
- **Real-Time Requirements:** ICS/OT networks often require real-time communication and control, making it difficult to implement security measures that might introduce latency \[4].
- **Safety Concerns:** Security breaches in ICS/OT networks can have serious safety implications \[5, 6]. Therefore, any security measures implemented must not compromise the safety of the system.

### Key Zero Trust Principles and their Application

Despite these challenges, applying Zero Trust principles can significantly enhance the security of ICS/OT networks. The sources focus on these key principles:

1. **Assume Breach:** Recognising that an attacker might already be present in the network \[7] is crucial. This principle promotes a proactive security posture, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security models that assume the network within the perimeter is safe. Applying this principle involves:

- **Continuous Monitoring and Detection:** Employing tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to monitor network traffic and identify suspicious activities \[8-11].
- **Microsegmentation:** Dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to contain potential breaches and limit lateral movement \[12-14].
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforcing MFA for all users accessing the network \[15], which makes it harder for attackers to gain access even if they compromise one factor, like a password.

1. **Least Privilege:** The principle of least privilege dictates that users and devices should only have access to the resources necessary for their tasks \[16]. Applying this in an ICS/OT context requires:

- **Strict Access Controls:** Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to define and manage user permissions \[16].
- **Network Segmentation:** Separating the network into different security zones based on the sensitivity of data and systems \[12, 13], with strict firewall rules governing traffic between zones \[17, 18].
- **Unidirectional Gateways:** Using data diodes for one-way data transfer between network segments \[15, 19, 20]. This allows information to flow out of the OT network without allowing anything back in, effectively isolating critical systems.

1. **Continuous Verification:** Zero Trust mandates that every connection attempt be authenticated and authorized, regardless of its origin \[7]. This involves verifying both the identity of the user or device and their permissions to access the requested resources. Some key methods include:

- **Strong Password Policies:** Enforcing complex passwords and regular password changes \[21].
- **Device Authentication:** Authenticating devices connecting to the network to ensure they are authorized and not compromised \[22].
- **Real-Time Policy Enforcement:** Using dynamic policies that can adapt to changing conditions and threat intelligence \[23, 24]. For instance, access might be automatically revoked if a device exhibits suspicious behaviour.

### Essential Steps for Implementation

The sources also provide a roadmap for implementing Zero Trust in an ICS/OT network \[24, 25]:

1. **Asset and Device Inventory:** Creating a comprehensive inventory of all assets, devices, network connections, protocols, workflows, and dependencies \[25]. This mapping process is fundamental to understanding the current state of the network and identifying potential risks.
2. **Microsegmentation and Unidirectional Gateways:** Implementing microsegmentation to create isolated security zones and employing data diodes for one-way data transfer \[14, 15]. This helps to contain breaches and protect critical systems.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Enforcing MFA for all user access \[15] to strengthen authentication and reduce the risk of compromised credentials.
4. **Policies and Procedures:** Establishing and enforcing robust security policies and procedures that require authentication and authorisation for every connection \[23]. This includes policies for password management, device security, remote access, and incident response.
5. **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Implementing a SIEM solution to collect and analyse logs from all assets \[24]. This allows for real-time threat detection, analysis, and incident response.
