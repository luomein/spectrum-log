# Reshaping the Power Grid

### Two Fundamental Shifts on the Power Grid

> [!CAUTION]
> The sources, primarily focusing on cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems (ICS), don't directly discuss the evolving architecture of the electric grid. However, one source, \[1], does touch upon this topic while examining the implications of the 2015 cyberattack on Ukrainian electric utilities. This source identifies two fundamental shifts that are transforming the U.S. electric grid:

### 1. Decentralisation of Power Generation

The traditional electric grid model relied heavily on large, centralised power plants generating electricity and transmitting it over long distances to consumers. This model is now shifting towards a more decentralised approach, with smaller-scale power generation sources located closer to consumers. A prime example is **rooftop solar**, which allows individual homes and businesses to generate their own electricity.

This shift towards decentralisation has several implications:

- **Reduced Reliance on Large Power Plants:** The grid becomes less vulnerable to disruptions caused by outages at a single large power plant.
- **Increased Resilience:** With multiple, distributed generation sources, the grid can continue operating even if some sources are unavailable.
- **Reduced Transmission Losses:** Generating power closer to where it's consumed minimises energy losses during transmission.
- **Empowerment of Consumers:** Individuals and businesses gain more control over their energy production and consumption.

### 2. Integration of Advanced Technologies

The second shift involves the integration of advanced technologies that enhance grid resilience and flexibility. One key technology highlighted is **battery-based energy storage**. These systems can store excess electricity generated from sources like solar or wind power and discharge it when demand exceeds generation.

This integration of advanced technologies brings several advantages:

- **Enhanced Grid Stability:** Energy storage helps balance supply and demand fluctuations, ensuring grid stability and reliability.
- **Increased Renewable Energy Integration:** Energy storage addresses the intermittency challenges of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, smoothing out their variable output.
- **Improved Grid Efficiency:** By optimising energy dispatch and reducing peak demand, energy storage can enhance overall grid efficiency.
- **Support for Microgrids:** Energy storage is a crucial component of microgrids, allowing them to operate independently from the main grid during outages.

> ### Driving Forces Behind the Transformation
> 
> The source \[2] attributes the adoption of these transformative technologies to several factors:
> 
> - **Declining Technology Costs:** The cost of renewable energy technologies like solar PV and battery storage has decreased significantly in recent years, making them more economically viable.
> - **Environmental Policies:** Government policies promoting renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions are incentivising the shift towards cleaner energy sources.
> - **Customer Demand:** Consumers are increasingly demanding clean energy options, driving businesses and utilities to adopt renewable energy and related technologies.

> [!WARNING]
> ### Impact on Cybersecurity
> 
> While the sources don't directly link these shifts to cybersecurity, it's worth noting that a more decentralised and technologically advanced grid presents both opportunities and challenges for cybersecurity. A more distributed grid with numerous interconnected devices and systems could potentially expand the attack surface and introduce new vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the integration of advanced technologies like energy storage and smart grid systems can also provide opportunities for enhanced monitoring, control, and security.
