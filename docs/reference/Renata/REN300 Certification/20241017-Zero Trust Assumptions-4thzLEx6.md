# Zero Trust Assumptions

## Zero Trust Assumptions

The "Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training - 300" training guide outlines three key assumptions underpinning the Zero Trust methodology:

- **The attacker is already inside.** \[1] This assumption acknowledges that traditional security perimeters are no longer sufficient to protect networks. Attackers may have already gained a foothold within the network through various means, such as compromised credentials, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in external-facing systems.
- **No network or device is inherently trusted.** \[1] This principle challenges the traditional approach of implicitly trusting devices and users within the network perimeter. Zero Trust assumes that any device or user, regardless of location or network segment, could potentially be compromised and pose a threat.
- **Every connection needs to be authenticated (verify the user or device) and authorised (verify access privileges).** \[1] This assumption highlights the importance of verifying the identity and permissions of every user and device attempting to access network resources. Zero Trust enforces strict access controls, ensuring that only authenticated and authorised entities can connect to specific resources and perform permitted actions.

These assumptions underscore the shift from a perimeter-based security model to a data-centric approach, where trust is continuously evaluated and validated for every connection and access request. This principle aligns with the broader trend of adopting a defence-in-depth strategy, as discussed earlier in our conversation, by layering multiple security controls to mitigate risks and enhance resilience against cyber threats.
