# Honeypots

## Purpose and Functionality

> [!NOTE]
> A honeypot is a **decoy system** intentionally set up to attract and engage attackers, giving the appearance of a legitimate and valuable target.

**Purpose of Honeypots:**

The primary purposes of deploying a honeypot within a network are:

- **Early Warning System:** A honeypot acts as an alarm, alerting security teams to potential intrusions or malicious activities within the network. Any interaction with a honeypot, which is not expected to receive legitimate traffic, is considered suspicious and triggers an alert. \[1, 2]
- **Information Gathering:** Honeypots are instrumental in gathering information about attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). They provide valuable insights into the tools, exploits, and motives employed by adversaries. This information helps security professionals understand the evolving threat landscape, improve security posture, and develop more effective defences. \[1]
- **Deception and Delay:** Honeypots can deceive attackers into believing they have successfully compromised a valuable target, diverting their attention from critical systems and buying time for security teams to respond and mitigate the threat. \[1]

**Types of Honeypots:**

- **Canaries:** These are simple honeypots designed not to communicate with any other system on the network. Any traffic directed to or from a canary is immediately flagged as suspicious, providing an early warning of potential malicious activity. \[2]
- **ICS-Specific Honeypots:** These honeypots are specifically designed to emulate industrial control systems (ICS) environments and attract attackers targeting critical infrastructure. They help researchers and security teams understand the unique threats facing ICS, develop tailored defences, and protect critical operations. \[2]

**Honeynet Project:**

The sources highlight the Honeynet Project, established in 1999, as the world's leading initiative in honeypot research and deployment. This project operates the largest distributed honeypot network, providing valuable data and insights into global cyber threats. The Honeynet Project operates on an open-source model, making its findings and tools accessible to the broader security community. \[2]

**Conpot:**

The sources mention Conpot as a prominent ICS-specific honeypot, available on GitHub. It simulates a variety of ICS protocols and devices, attracting attackers targeting industrial control systems and providing valuable data on their activities. \[3]

**Benefits of Honeypots:**

- Enhanced Threat Detection and Response
- Improved Understanding of Attacker TTPs
- Deception and Delay Tactics
- Valuable Data for Security Research and Development


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Honeypots are essential tools for modern cybersecurity, offering an effective means of detecting threats, gathering intelligence, and deceiving attackers. Their ability to attract and engage adversaries provides valuable insights into the evolving threat landscape, allowing security teams to stay ahead of sophisticated attacks.
