# Two Types of Network Discovery

## Two Types of Network Discovery

The sources, particularly the "Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training - 300" document, identify **two primary methods of network discovery**: **passive discovery** and **active discovery**. These techniques are essential for understanding network topology, identifying active devices, and assessing potential security vulnerabilities.

### Passive Discovery

**Passive discovery** involves observing and analysing existing network traffic **without actively probing or interacting with target systems**. It's akin to using your senses to gather information about your surroundings. This method is generally considered less intrusive and less likely to disrupt critical operations, making it a preferred approach, especially in sensitive environments like industrial control systems (ICS).

**Key Characteristics of Passive Discovery:**

- **Non-intrusive:** No packets are sent to the target network.
- **Reliance on Existing Traffic:** It leverages the network traffic generated by normal operations.
- **Limited Information:** Provides a snapshot of current activity but may not reveal all devices or services.
- **Reduced Risk of Disruption:** Minimises the chance of triggering unexpected behaviour in sensitive devices.

**Techniques Used in Passive Discovery:**

- **Network Sniffing:** Capturing and analysing network packets using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to identify active hosts, communication protocols, and data patterns.
- **ARP Table Analysis:** Examining the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table on a local machine to identify recently communicated devices based on MAC address mappings.
- **Reviewing Logs and Configuration Files:** Analysing system logs, firewall logs, and configuration files to glean information about network connections, active services, and user activity.
- **Monitoring Network Traffic:** Observing network traffic patterns using tools like NetFlow to detect anomalies, identify active hosts, and understand communication flows.

### Active Discovery

**Active discovery**, in contrast, involves **actively probing target systems and networks to elicit responses**. This probing typically involves sending various network packets, such as ICMP echo requests (ping), TCP SYN packets (port scanning), and UDP probes. While this method provides more comprehensive information about the network, it carries a higher risk of disrupting critical operations or exposing vulnerabilities.

**Key Characteristics of Active Discovery:**

- **Intrusive:** Actively sends packets to the target network.
- **Elicits Responses:** Provokes responses from target systems to gather information.
- **More Comprehensive Information:** Can reveal a wider range of devices, services, and system details.
- **Higher Risk of Disruption:** Can trigger unexpected behaviour in sensitive devices, potentially disrupting operations.

**Techniques Used in Active Discovery:**

- **Port Scanning:** Using tools like Nmap to scan target systems for open ports and identify running services.
- **Ping Sweeps:** Sending ICMP echo requests to a range of IP addresses to identify active hosts.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employing tools like Nessus to probe systems for known vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.
- **OS Fingerprinting:** Analysing responses to network probes to identify the operating system of target devices.

**Risks of Active Discovery in ICS Environments:**

The sources, particularly the "Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training - 300" guide, strongly caution against conducting active discovery on ICS networks without proper authorisation and a thorough understanding of the potential risks. Active probes can potentially disrupt sensitive processes, trigger vulnerabilities, or expose critical infrastructure to attacks. The guide emphasizes the need for careful planning, risk assessment, and coordination with ICS engineers and operators before undertaking active discovery in such environments.
