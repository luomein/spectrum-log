# The Five Phases of Incident Response

## The Five Phases of Incident Response

The "Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training - 300" guide outlines **five key phases of incident response:**

1. **Preparation**
2. **Identification**
3. **Containment**
4. **Clean-up and Recovery**
5. **Follow-up**

These phases provide a structured approach to handling security incidents, minimising damage, and ensuring a swift return to normal operations. The guide emphasises the importance of an **intelligence-driven incident response**, leveraging threat intelligence and insights gained from past incidents to enhance preparedness and response effectiveness.

### 1. Preparation Phase

The preparation phase focuses on proactive measures to ensure readiness for handling incidents. This involves developing an incident response plan, assembling an incident response team, conducting training exercises, and establishing communication channels.

**Key Activities during the Preparation Phase:**

- **Develop an Incident Response Plan:** A comprehensive plan outlining roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, escalation procedures, and technical steps for responding to various types of incidents.
- **Assemble an Incident Response Team:** A dedicated team comprising individuals with diverse skills and expertise, including technical staff, security analysts, system administrators, legal counsel, and public relations representatives.
- **Conduct Training Exercises:** Regular training exercises and simulations to ensure team members understand their roles, procedures, and technical tools, and to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.
- **Establish Communication Channels:** Secure and reliable communication channels for internal team coordination, communication with external stakeholders, and public notifications.
- **Gather Malware Indicators:** Proactively collect and analyse threat intelligence to identify potential malware indicators, such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names associated with known threats.

### 2. Identification Phase

The identification phase aims to confirm whether a security incident has occurred and gather information about its nature and scope. This involves analysing logs, monitoring network traffic, and conducting forensic investigations.

**Key Activities during the Identification Phase:**

- **Collect and Preserve Log Information:** Secure and preserve all relevant log data from various systems, including network devices, servers, workstations, and security tools.
- **Analyse Logs for Suspicious Activity:** Use log analysis tools and techniques to identify patterns, anomalies, and indicators of compromise, such as unauthorised access attempts, unusual network activity, or changes to system files.
- **Employ Malware Detection Tools:** Use tools like YARA to scan systems for known malware indicators based on predefined rules and signatures.
- **Conduct Forensic Investigations:** Perform detailed forensic analysis of compromised systems to uncover evidence of malicious activity, identify attack vectors, and determine the extent of the damage.

### 3. Containment Phase

The containment phase focuses on limiting the spread and impact of the security incident. This may involve isolating affected systems, blocking malicious traffic, disabling compromised accounts, and implementing other damage control measures.

**Key Activities during the Containment Phase:**

- **Isolate Affected Systems:** Disconnect compromised systems from the network to prevent further spread of malware or data exfiltration.
- **Block Malicious Traffic:** Use firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other security controls to block traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses or domains.
- **Disable Compromised Accounts:** Disable or reset passwords for compromised user accounts to prevent further unauthorized access.
- **Implement Damage Control Measures:** Take steps to mitigate the immediate impact of the incident, such as restoring critical services, recovering data from backups, or implementing workarounds.

### 4. Clean-up and Recovery Phase

The clean-up and recovery phase aims to eradicate the threat, restore affected systems to a secure state, and recover lost or compromised data. This may involve malware removal, system rebuilding, data restoration, and security hardening.

**Key Activities during the Clean-up and Recovery Phase:**

- **Eradicate Malware:** Use anti-malware tools, system cleaning utilities, or manual removal techniques to remove all traces of malware from affected systems.
- **Rebuild Compromised Systems:** In cases of severe compromise, consider rebuilding affected systems from scratch using clean and trusted sources, such as verified backups or gold standard images.
- **Restore Data from Backups:** Recover lost or compromised data from secure and reliable backups, ensuring the backups are free from malware infection.
- **Security Hardening:** Implement additional security measures, such as patching vulnerabilities, strengthening access controls, and improving network segmentation, to prevent future incidents.

### 5. Follow-up Phase

The follow-up phase involves documenting lessons learned, updating incident response procedures, enhancing security controls, and communicating findings to relevant stakeholders.

**Key Activities during the Follow-up Phase:**

- **Document Incident Report:** Prepare a comprehensive incident report detailing the timeline of events, root cause analysis, impact assessment, remediation steps, and recommendations for improvement.
- **Update Incident Response Plan:** Review and update the incident response plan based on lessons learned, incorporating new insights and best practices.
- **Enhance Threat Intelligence:** Update threat intelligence feeds, malware signatures, and other security controls to improve detection and prevention capabilities.
- **Communicate Findings:** Communicate findings and recommendations to relevant stakeholders, including management, IT staff, security personnel, and external partners, to foster awareness and improve future response efforts.

By following this five-phase approach, organisations can establish a robust incident response framework, effectively manage security incidents, minimise downtime, and enhance their overall security posture.
