# Pillars of the Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM)

### Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) 

> [!NOTE]
> The "Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training - 300" guide outlines the Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) as a framework for designing and implementing a Zero Trust Architecture. The ZTMM divides the enterprise into **five distinct pillars** to facilitate a phased and manageable approach to Zero Trust adoption.

These pillars are:

1. **Identity:** This pillar focuses on verifying and authenticating users and devices before granting them access to network resources. It encompasses aspects such as strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication), identity management systems, and access control policies. \[1]
2. **Devices:** The devices pillar emphasises securing and monitoring all devices connected to the network, including laptops, servers, workstations, mobile devices, and IoT devices. It includes measures such as device posture checks, vulnerability management, and endpoint security solutions. \[1]
3. **Network:** This pillar centres around securing the network infrastructure and controlling traffic flow between different network segments. It encompasses techniques like micro-segmentation, network access control, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and secure network protocols. \[1]
4. **Applications:** The applications pillar focuses on securing the applications that users access and use. It includes measures such as application whitelisting, vulnerability scanning, secure coding practices, and application firewalls. \[1]
5. **Data:** This pillar prioritises protecting sensitive data through encryption, data loss prevention mechanisms, access controls, and data governance policies. It ensures that data is appropriately classified, stored, and accessed based on the principle of least privilege. \[1]

The ZTMM recognises that each of these pillars will likely progress at its own pace, allowing organisations to adopt a gradual implementation of Zero Trust, spreading costs and efforts over time. \[2]

> [!NOTE]
> The importance of three overarching capabilities that support the implementation of the ZTMM pillars:
> 
> - **Visibility and Analytics:** This capability involves gaining comprehensive visibility into network activity, user behaviour, and system configurations to identify anomalies, threats, and security gaps. It relies on tools like security information and event management (SIEM) systems, log analysis platforms, and network monitoring solutions. \[1]
> - **Automation and Orchestration:** This capability focuses on automating security processes, such as identity verification, access control, vulnerability remediation, and incident response, to improve efficiency, consistency, and response times. \[1]
> - **Governance:** This capability ensures that appropriate policies, procedures, and controls are in place to manage and enforce security across the organisation. It includes aspects like risk management, compliance monitoring, and security awareness training. \[1]



> [!IMPORTANT]
>  ZTMM provides a structured approach for organisations to transition from traditional perimeter-based security models to a more robust and adaptable Zero Trust Architecture, enhancing their ability to mitigate modern cyber threats and protect critical assets.
