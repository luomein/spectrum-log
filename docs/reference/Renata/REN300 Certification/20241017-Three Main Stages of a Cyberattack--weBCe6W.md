### Target Development (TD)

This stage involves gathering information about an organisation to identify vulnerabilities and plan an attack. This may include:

- **Goals and Target Selection** \[3]
- **Target Research** \[4]
- **Social Engineering** \[5]
- **Target Configuration** \[5]
- **Exploring Potential Entry Points** \[6]
- **Planning the Attack** \[7]
- **Building a Toolkit** \[8]

### Exploitation and Pivoting (E\&P)

This stage involves using exploits to gain access to a target system and then pivoting to other systems on the network.

**Exploitation** is the process of using an attack to take advantage of a vulnerability. The **attacker's trifecta** is a combination of a **vulnerability**, an **exploit**, and an **attack path**, all three of which an attacker must have to be successful. \[9]

**Pivoting** is the process of using a compromised system to gain access to other systems on the network. This is often done by using the compromised system as a **proxy**, or by using the compromised system to **launch attacks** against other systems. \[8]

### Attack Operations

This stage involves carrying out the attacker's objectives, which could include:

- **Bypassing Network Controls** \[10]
- **Command and Control** \[11]
- **Persistent and Remote Access** \[12]
- **Data Exfiltration** \[13]
- **Process Manipulation** \[14]
- **Denial of Service** \[13]

> [!NOTE]
> > ### Tools
> 
> Attackers will use a variety of tools to carry out these activities. One example is the **Metasploit Framework**, which can be used to plan attacks, develop exploits, and manage compromised systems. \[15, 16]
