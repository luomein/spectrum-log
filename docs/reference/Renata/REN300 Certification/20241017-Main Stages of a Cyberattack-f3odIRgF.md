# Main Stages of a Cyberattack

## Main Stages of a Cyberattack

The ICS Cybersecurity Training identifies three main stages involved in carrying out a cyberattack \[1]:

**1. Target Development (TD)**

This initial stage focuses on gathering information about the target organisation and identifying potential attack vectors. Attackers aim to understand the organisation's structure, operations, systems, and security posture \[1]. This stage typically involves activities such as:

- **Open-Source Research:** Analysing publicly available information, such as company websites, social media profiles, news articles, and technical forums, to gather insights into the target's infrastructure, technologies, and key personnel \[2].
- **Social Engineering:** Using deceptive techniques, such as phishing emails or impersonating legitimate entities, to manipulate individuals within the target organisation and gain access to sensitive information or systems \[3].

**2. Exploitation and Pivoting (E\&P)**

Once attackers have gathered sufficient information about the target, they move on to exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining access to the network. This stage encompasses two main aspects \[4]:

- **Exploitation:** Using identified vulnerabilities and appropriate exploits to gain an initial point of entry (PoE) on the target system \[4]. This might involve leveraging software flaws, misconfigurations, or weak security controls to execute malicious code or gain unauthorised access.
- **Pivoting:** Once an initial foothold is established, attackers leverage their access to explore the network further, identify additional targets of interest, and compromise them. Pivoting techniques allow attackers to move laterally within the network, often escalating their privileges and expanding their control over systems and data \[4].

**3. Attack Operations**

This final stage marks the culmination of the attacker's efforts, where they leverage their access to achieve their objectives, which may vary depending on the attacker's motivations and goals \[5]. Some common attack operations include:

- **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data, such as financial records, intellectual property, or customer information, for financial gain, espionage, or other malicious purposes \[5].
- **System Disruption:** Disrupting critical systems or processes, potentially causing financial losses, reputational damage, or safety hazards \[5].
- **Espionage:** Gathering intelligence on the target organisation's activities, strategies, or technologies \[5].
- **Propaganda:** Spreading misinformation or propaganda to damage the target organisation's reputation or influence public opinion \[5].

The sources emphasise that modern cyberattacks are often carried out by well-organised and highly skilled adversaries who employ sophisticated techniques and tools \[6]. The three stages described above provide a framework for understanding the typical attack lifecycle and highlight the importance of implementing comprehensive security measures to protect against threats at each stage.
