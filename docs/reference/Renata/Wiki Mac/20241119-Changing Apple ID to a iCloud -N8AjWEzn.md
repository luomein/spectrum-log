# Changing Apple ID to a iCloud 

## Important Considerations

- **Existing @icloud.com Address:** Ensure the @icloud.com email address you wish to use is already associated with your Apple ID. If not, you cannot change your Apple ID to this address.

- **Apple ID Restrictions:** You cannot merge two separate Apple IDs. Changing the email address associated with your Apple ID does not affect your data, purchases, or contacts linked to that account. 

## Steps on an iPhone or iPad

1. **Open Settings:** Tap the Settings app on your home screen.

2. **Access Apple ID Settings:** Tap your name at the top of the screen.

3. **Navigate to Sign-In & Security:** Tap "Sign-In & Security."

4. **Manage Email Addresses:** Tap "Email & Phone Numbers."

5. **Edit Primary Email:** Tap "Edit" next to the primary email address.

6. **Remove Gmail Address:** Tap the remove button next to the Gmail address, then tap "Delete."

7. **Choose New Email Address:** Tap "Choose Another Email Address" and enter the device passcode if prompted.

8. **Enter @icloud.com Address:** Input the existing @icloud.com email address you wish to use and tap "Continue."

9. **Verify Email Address:** Enter the verification code sent to the @icloud.com email address to confirm the change.

## Steps on a Computer

1. **Visit Apple ID Website:** Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) and sign in with your current Apple ID.

2. **Access Sign-In & Security:** In the "Sign-In and Security" section, select "Apple ID."

3. **Enter New Email Address:** Input the existing @icloud.com email address you wish to use.

4. **Change Apple ID:** Click "Change Apple ID."

5. **Verify Email Address:** Check your @icloud.com email for a verification code and enter it to confirm the change.

## After Changing Your Apple ID

- **Sign Out and Back In:** After changing the email address, sign out of your Apple ID on all devices and sign back in with the updated Apple ID to maintain access to services like iCloud and the App Store.

- **Update App Store and iTunes:** Ensure you're signed in with the updated Apple ID in the App Store and iTunes to access your purchases.

- **Verify Services:** Check that services like iMessage, FaceTime, and iCloud are functioning correctly with the new Apple ID.

By following these steps, you can successfully change your Apple ID from a Gmail address to an existing @icloud.com address.
