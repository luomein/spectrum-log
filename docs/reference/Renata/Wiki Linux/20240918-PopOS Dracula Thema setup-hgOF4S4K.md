i don't use zhs only bash

Understood. Since you're using Bash instead of Zsh, let's focus on customizing Bash to complement your Dracula theme in Pop!_OS:

## Customizing Bash for Dracula Theme

1. Install the Dracula theme for Bash:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/bash
curl -o ~/.config/bash/dracula.theme.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dracula/bash/master/dracula.theme.sh
```

2. Edit your `.bashrc` file:

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

3. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
# Dracula Theme for Bash
if [ -f ~/.config/bash/dracula.theme.sh ]; then
    . ~/.config/bash/dracula.theme.sh
fi

# Custom prompt
PS1='\[\033[1;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[1;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '

# Colorize ls output
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
```

4. Save and exit the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

5. Apply the changes:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Additional Bash Enhancements

1. Install `bash-completion` for better command completion:

```
sudo apt install bash-completion
```

2. Add syntax highlighting to the command line:

```
sudo apt install source-highlight
echo 'export LESSOPEN="| /usr/share/source-highlight/src-hilite-lesspipe.sh %s"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LESS=" -R "' >> ~/.bashrc
```

3. Enable case-insensitive auto-completion by adding this to your `.inputrc`:

```
echo 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> ~/.inputrc
```

4. Add some useful aliases to your `.bashrc`:

```bash
# Add these to the end of your .bashrc file
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
alias clean='sudo apt autoremove && sudo apt autoclean'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
```

5. Enable command history search with arrow keys by adding these lines to `.inputrc`:

```
echo '"\e[A": history-search-backward' >> ~/.inputrc
echo '"\e[B": history-search-forward' >> ~/.inputrc
```

These customizations will give your Bash environment a Dracula-themed look and enhance your command-line experience in Pop!_OS. The custom prompt will display your username, hostname, and current directory in Dracula-inspired colors. The additional enhancements improve functionality and ease of use in the terminal.

Remember to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` after making these changes for them to take effect.

Also add ohmyposh ruth the fitting ththeme

Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of installing Oh My Posh and setting up the Ruth theme, which complements the Dracula theme nicely. Here's how to do it:

## Installing Oh My Posh

1. First, install Oh My Posh using the installation script:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash
```

2. After installation, add Oh My Posh to your PATH by adding this line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

## Setting Up the Ruth Theme

1. Create a directory for Oh My Posh themes:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/oh-my-posh/themes
```

2. Download the Ruth theme:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/ruth.omp.json -o ~/.config/oh-my-posh/themes/ruth.omp.json
```

3. Edit your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

4. Add the following lines at the end of the file to initialize Oh My Posh with the Ruth theme:

```bash
# Initialize Oh My Posh with Ruth theme
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/.config/oh-my-posh/themes/ruth.omp.json)"
```

5. Save and exit the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

6. Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Additional Customizations

1. If you want to customize the Ruth theme, you can edit the `~/.config/oh-my-posh/themes/ruth.omp.json` file.

2. To ensure the theme displays correctly, make sure you're using a Nerd Font in your terminal. You can download one from the Nerd Fonts website and set it as your terminal font.

3. If you encounter any rendering issues, you might need to adjust your terminal's color scheme to match the Dracula theme more closely.

Now your Bash prompt should be using the Oh My Posh Ruth theme, which features a clean and informative layout that complements the Dracula theme well. The prompt will display useful information such as the current directory, Git status (if applicable), and execution time of the last command.

Remember that Oh My Posh themes are highly customizable, so feel free to adjust the Ruth theme or explore other themes that might suit your preferences even better.

```

Then edit the exported JSON file to adjust colors, segments, or layout to your liking.
