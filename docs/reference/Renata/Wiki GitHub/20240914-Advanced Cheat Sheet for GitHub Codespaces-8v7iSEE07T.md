# Advanced Cheat Sheet for GitHub Codespaces



## 1. Advanced Container Configuration

- **Using devcontainer.json:**
  - Customize the development environment by adding a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Environment",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/python:3",
    "extensions": [
      "ms-python.python",
      "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
    ],
    "settings": {
      "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Docker-Compose for Multi-Container Environments:**
  - Use `docker-compose.yml` to define multiple containers running in your development environment:
  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    web:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "80:80"
    db:
      image: postgres
  ```

## 2. Performance and Resource Optimization

- **Set Codespace Size and Type:**
  - Choose the appropriate size and type of codespace based on your project's requirements.

- **Create Custom Environments:**
  - Use pre-configured images or create your own Docker images to optimize the development environment.

## 3. Advanced Collaboration and Sharing

- **Invite Guests in Live Share:**
  - Use **Live Share** settings to invite guest developers and configure their access rights.

- **Pre-Configure Codespaces:**
  - Use the `.github/codespaces` folder to define default settings and workflows for your organization.

## 4. Automation and CI/CD

- **Automated Workflows with GitHub Actions:**
  - Integrate GitHub Actions to perform automatic tests and deployments directly from the codespace.

- **Use Custom Dotfiles:**
  - Configure dotfiles to synchronize custom environments and settings.

## 5. Advanced Security Policies

- **Configure Network Access and Firewalls:**
  - Define network security policies to control access to your codespaces.

- **Manage Secure Secrets:**
  - Use GitHub Secrets to protect API keys and other sensitive information.

## 6. Tips for Advanced Users

- **Use VS Code Remote Extensions:**
  - Leverage **Remote-SSH** or **Remote-Containers** to extend local development.

- **Set Up Automated Maintenance Tasks:**
  - Schedule regular maintenance tasks like cleaning up containers or updating dependencies.
