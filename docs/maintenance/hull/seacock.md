## Gease Nipple

* Open to gease

* Use wire to check the the nipple is not blocked. If the handle is closed and you inserted the wire into the nipple, a small stream of water may come out of the nipple, in case of this happens, just turn the handle to open, then the stream will be stopped.

* After geasing, rotate the gease pipe will make it easier to come off.
