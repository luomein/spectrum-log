## Racor

working log at 2025/05/01, replaced with a new one (Sakura Fuel Water Separator)

* Drain the fuel out by opening the screw underneath the racor.

* Use the Belt Strap Wrench to take the racor down.

* The racor's thread is viewing from underneath.

## Fine Fuel Filter

working log at 2025/05/01, replaced with a new one from Yanmar

* The Belt Strap Wrench is not helpful here, instead, use a flat skewdriver and a rubber hammer to work on the teeth of the retaining ring.

* The retaining ring's thread is viewing from underneath.

## Air Bleeding

working log at 2025/05/01

  * Racor (primary fuel filter and water seperator) does not need air bleeding
    
    There is a vent screw on the Racor. Some YouTube shows how to bleed it. However, in my engine, this vent screw is not working. I guess it is blocked.

  * Fuel pump work as if 'dual-stage'

    To make the fuel pump works, you need to press it to the second stage, which will have a click sound. If you only press it in the first stage, it will never work.

  * There are two bleed screws before the injection pump. They are both Phillips screws.

  * There is no need to bleed the fitting nut on the injector this time since the engine already started properly
