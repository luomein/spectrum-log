## Air Bleeding

* working log at 2025/05/01

  * Racor (primary fuel filter and water seperator) does not need air bleeding
    
    There is a vent screw on the Racor. Some YouTube shows how to bleed it. However, in my engine, this vent screw is not working. I guess it is blocked.

  * Fuel pump work as if 'dual-stage'

    To make the fuel pump works, you need to press it to the second stage, which will have a click sound. If you only press it in the first stage, it will never work.

  * There are two bleeding screws before the injection pump
