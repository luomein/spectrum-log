## DIN766 and ISO4565

[Calibrated Anchor Chain - General Information](https://jimmygreen.com/content/219-calibrated-anchor-chain-general-information)

> There are only two main calibrations for chains manufactured in Europe: DIN766 and ISO4565.

> The good news is that the dimensions for 6mm, 8mm and 12mm are identical.

> 10mm is more difficult because the dimensions are different for DIN766 and ISO4565.

> Both 10mm calibrations are very commonly used in Europe.

> Be aware that selecting the wrong calibration, particularly in 7mm or 10mm, on the vast majority of windlasses will result in ‘jamming’ or ‘jumping’ under load.

> 7mm is also tricky because the dimensions are sufficiently different to create problems on most windlass gypsys.

> To make matters worse, 7mm ISO4565 is not generally available from any calibrated anchor chain marine manufacturer.

> US Calibrations are entirely different to European DIN766 or ISO4565, and they will generally only work on their US matching gypsy. US Calibrated chain is not readily available in Europe. You can replace your US-calibrated chain with a European calibration, but the prudent course of action will be to replace the gypsy to match.
