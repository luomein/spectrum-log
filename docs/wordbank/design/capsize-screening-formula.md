# Capsize screening formula

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsize_screening_formula)

> The capsize screening formula (CSF) is a controversial method of establishing the ability of boats to resist capsizing. It is defined for sailboats as: Beam / ((Displacement/64.2)1/3), with Displacement measured in pounds, and Beam in feet. A lower figure supposedly indicates greater stability, however the calculation does not consider factors such as hull shape or ballast.

> A value of 2 is taken as a cutoff for acceptable to certain race committees.
