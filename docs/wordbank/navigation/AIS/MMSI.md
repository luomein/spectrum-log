# MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity number)

AIS and VHF devices bound to a specific MMSI. If you want to change the MMSI, you need to bring the AIS and VHF to the dealer. But if your model is too old, the dealer will not help you either.

## Vessel's Flag

[reference](https://support.marinetraffic.com/en/articles/9552863-how-does-marinetraffic-identify-a-vessel-s-country-and-flag)

the MMSI number indicates the vessel's flag.

The initial digit of a ship station determines the vessel's area of origin:
 
* 2 = Europe

* 3 = North America, Central America and Caribbean

* 4 = Asia

* 5 = Oceania

* 6 = Africa

* 7 = South America

The next 2 digits make each MMSI country-specific. This is how the vessel's flag can be identified.
