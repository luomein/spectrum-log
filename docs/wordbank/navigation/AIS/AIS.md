# AIS

## AIS Regulation

[reference](https://community.magicport.ai/t/indicating-the-port-of-destination-in-ais/1152)

> AIS was originally designed to avoid collisions, not as a vessel tracking & destination tracking system. There is a lack of consensus on standardizing AIS usage, there is no common body that mandates this.

### Japan Regulation

[reference](https://www.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/03kanku/h22houkaisei/sozai/guide3_e.pdf)

> In relation to amendments to the Port Regulations Law and the Maritime Traffic Safety Law, which specify the manner of entering the destination of a ship in the relevant data field in the AIS (automatic identification system), the entry of such information will become compulsory on and after July 1, 2010.

## data shared via AIS

[reference](https://sinay.ai/en/understand-everything-about-ais/)

AIS allows electronically data transmission of static and dynamic vessel information:  

* Vessel name and Maritime Mobile Service Identity number (MMSI), which is its unique identification number 

* Type of vessel: cargo, passenger, fishing; 

* Vessel’s current coordinates: latitude (LAT) and longitude (LON); 

* Vessel course over ground (COG) and speed over ground (SOG); 

* Vessels’ dimensions (length, width, and draft)  

* Vessels’ navigational status (“underway”, “at anchor”, “alongside” etc.), which is manually set by the crew;  

* Heading (0 to 359 degrees);  

* Rate of Turn-right or left (0 to 720 degrees per minute); 

* Bearing at own position (0 to 359 degrees); 

* Port Call Arrivals and/or Departures; 

* Distance to the closest point of approach (CPA);  

* Time to the closest point of approach (TCPA);  

* Time stamps (UTC), which is the UTC (in seconds) when the subject data packet was generated.
