There are various types of marine antennas, each designed for specific functions and frequency ranges. Common types include:

* VHF Antennas: For voice communication over the marine VHF radio frequencies.

* GPS Antennas: For receiving satellite signals used in navigation.

* Radar Antennas: For detecting other vessels and land obstacles.

* AM/FM Antennas: For receiving AM and FM radio signals.

* SSB Antennas: For long-range communication on the HF frequency band.

* AIS Antennas: For receiving Automatic Identification System signals from other vessels.

* Cellular Antennas: For improving cellular signal while on the water.

* Wi-Fi Antennas: For connecting to Wi-Fi networks while on the water.

* Satellite TV Antennas: For receiving satellite television signals while on the water.

* Emergency Antennas: For emergency communication and distress signals.

## SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) Test

Testing a marine antenna involves checking its SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) to ensure it is within acceptable limits.
