# T-terminal

Attachment to the Mast, the top terminals. The primary formats for swaged ends are Fixed Eye, Fixed Fork and T-terminal.

T-terminals or shroud terminals often provide the most difficult decision when replace the rigging.

It is best to match the T-terminal to the mast backing plate from the same manufacturer. The thickness and width of the head, as well as the angle of the load-bearing 'shoulders', are all critical factors in selecting the correct version.

N.B Selden T terminals are similar in size and shape to the Hasselfors Flat Head design.
